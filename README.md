#### 🚀 Databricks Lakehouse Pipeline using PySpark, Delta Lake & dbt

#### 📌 Project Overview
This project implements an end-to-end **Databricks Lakehouse data engineering pipeline** using **PySpark Structured Streaming**, **Delta Lake**, and **dbt**.  
The pipeline ingests multiple CSV files from **Databricks Volumes**, loads them into a **Bronze layer**, applies reusable transformation logic, and incrementally upserts data into a **Silver layer** using **Delta MERGE**.  
The curated datasets are further modeled using **dbt models and snapshots (Slowly Changing Dimensions – SCD)**.

The solution is designed to be **dynamic, reusable, and scalable** across multiple business entities such as **customers, trips, vehicles, payments, drivers, and locations**.

#### 🔁 End-to-End Workflow

#### 1️⃣ Source Ingestion – Bronze Layer

Source CSV files are ingested from Databricks Volumes using Structured Streaming.

```python
spark.readStream.format("csv") \
  .option("header","true") \
  .schema(schema) \
  .load("/Volumes/.../source_data/customers/")
Multiple entities are processed dynamically:

entities = ["customers","trips","vehicles","payments","drivers","locations"]

######Streaming Write to Bronze Tables

.writeStream \
  .format("delta") \
  .trigger(once=True) \
  .option("checkpointLocation", "...") \
  .toTable("pyspark_dbt.bronze.customers")
This approach enables incremental ingestion using micro-batch streaming.

#### 3️⃣ Reusable Transformation Framework

Python utility class is created to standardize transformations across all entities.

#### 3.1 Deduplication using CDC logic

```python
row_number().over(
    Window.partitionBy("dedupKey").orderBy(desc(cdc))
)
This keeps only the latest record per business key based on the CDC timestamp.

##### 3.2 Audit column generation
This column tracks when a record is processed by the pipeline.

### Incremental Upsert into Silver Layer

ensures:

--existing records are updated

--new records are inserted

--older data does not overwrite newer data

####Dynamic Multi-Entity Processing
for entity in entities:
    obj.upsert(...)


The same pipeline logic is reused for all datasets.

6️⃣ dbt Modeling Layer

Example dbt model:

select *
from {{ source("source_bronze", "trips") }}


####Jinja templating is used to dynamically generate SQL.

7️⃣ Slowly Changing Dimensions using dbt Snapshots

dbt snapshots are used to track historical changes for dimension tables such as DimVehicle.

8️⃣ Version Control using GitHub

All notebooks, PySpark utilities, and dbt projects are maintained in a Databricks Repo and pushed to GitHub.
Only code is versioned (data and Delta tables are excluded).

📘 Concepts Implemented and Learned
✔ PySpark Structured Streaming
.trigger(once=True)


#### Used streaming as an incremental ingestion mechanism.

✔ Delta Lake CDC-based MERGE
.whenMatchedUpdateAll(condition="src.ts >= trg.ts")
.whenNotMatchedInsertAll()

✔ Window Functions for Deduplication
row_number().over(Window.partitionBy(...).orderBy(...))

✔ Reusable Transformation Utilities

Transformation logic is encapsulated inside a reusable Python class.

✔ Dynamic and Scalable Pipelines
for entity in entities:

✔ Schema and Merge Debugging

Handled:

merge key mismatches

data type mismatches

duplicate inserts during upserts

incorrect CDC logic

✔ dbt Jinja Templating
{% for col in cols %}
  {{ col }}
{% endfor %}

✔ dbt Sources and Snapshots
{{ source("source_bronze","trips") }}


and SCD snapshots for historical tracking.

✔ Databricks Platform Features

Unity Catalog tables

Databricks Volumes

Databricks Repos

Streaming checkpoints

✔ GitHub-based Version Control

structured repository layout

commit and push using Databricks Repos

.gitignore best practices

🏁 Summary

This project demonstrates a production-oriented data engineering solution built on the Databricks Lakehouse platform.
It combines incremental ingestion, CDC-driven upserts, reusable PySpark transformations, scalable multi-entity processing,
and dbt-based analytical modeling with SCD tracking, all managed through GitHub for version control.
